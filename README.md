# repository-migrate
Migrate your repositories, BitBucket to GitHub (and vice versa)

## How to run
Best option (until I properly package this for pypi) is to install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) 


## Available Commands
* list-bitbucket-repositories
* list-github-repositories - list github repositories of your organization
* compare-bitbucket-github - compare (via slug) repositories between the two services
